# Tijah-Qibla

Android Application developed to get the right angle for Qibla.

## Geometric Calculation of Qibla Direction

The direction of Qibla at any point on the Earth's surface, assuming the Earth to be a perfect sphere, is given by the great circle passing through that point and the Kaabatullah at Makkah.
The angle between the true north at a place and the qibla direction there can be obtained by solving the spherical triangle whose vertices are, the north pole, the intended place, and Makkah.
